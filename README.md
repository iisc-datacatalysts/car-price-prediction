## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd DSP
   ```

2. **Install required packages:**
   
   The notebook will automatically install packages in the first cell, or you can install them manually:
   
   ```bash
   pip install shap lightgbm category_encoders catboost scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn gradio
   ```
   
   Note: Gradio is installed automatically when you run the interactive dashboard cells (Cell 80).

3. **Open the notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook DSPCourse_Project_UsedCarPricePrediction.ipynb
   ```

## 💻 Usage

### Running the Notebook

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter
2. Run all cells sequentially (Cell → Run All)
3. The notebook will:
   - Load data from GitHub
   - Perform data cleaning and feature engineering
   - Train multiple models
   - Evaluate performance
   - Save model artifacts to `artifacts/` directory

### Making Predictions

After training, you can use the `predict_single()` function to predict prices for new cars:

```python
# Example usage
example_car = {
    'name': 'Maruti Swift Dzire VDI',
    'year': 2014,
    'kms_driven': 145500,
    'fuel': 'Diesel',
    'transmission': 'Manual',
    'owner': 'First Owner',
    'mileage': '23.4 kmpl',
    'engine': '1248 CC',
    'max_power': '74 bhp',
    'torque': '190Nm@ 2000rpm',
    'seats': 5.0
}

predicted_price = predict_single(example_car)
print(f"Predicted Price: ₹{predicted_price:,.0f}")
```

**Note:** `seller_type` is present in the dataset but is not used as a feature in the model. The model uses `fuel`, `transmission`, and `owner` as categorical features. You can omit `seller_type` from the input dictionary.

### Interactive Price Prediction Dashboard

The notebook includes an interactive Gradio web interface for easy price predictions. The dashboard is embedded directly in the notebook and provides a user-friendly way to estimate car prices.

**To use the dashboard:**

1. **Run all previous cells** (especially model training cells) to ensure the model is trained
2. **Run Cell 79-82** to launch the Gradio interface:
   - Cell 79: Markdown header for the dashboard section
   - Cell 80: Installs Gradio library
   - Cell 81: Defines helper functions for parsing and feature engineering
   - Cell 82: Creates and launches the Gradio interface

**Dashboard Features:**
- **Two-column layout**: Required fields on the left, optional fields on the right
- **Input validation**: Checks required fields before prediction
- **Example inputs**: 3 pre-filled examples you can click to auto-fill the form
- **Real-time predictions**: Instant price estimates with formatted display
- **Public URL**: Automatically generates a shareable link (works great in Google Colab)
- **Embedded interface**: Displays directly in the notebook output

**Accessing the Dashboard URL:**

When you run Cell 82, Gradio automatically generates a public URL that will be displayed in the notebook output. The URL format is typically:
- **Public URL**: `https://xxxxx.gradio.live` (shareable, expires in 1 week)
- **Local URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:7860` (works when running locally in Jupyter)

**Example Output:**
```
Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860
Running on public URL: https://xxxxx.gradio.live

This share link expires in 1 week. For free permanent hosting and GPU upgrades, 
run `gradio deploy` from the terminal to deploy to Hugging Face Spaces.
```

**Important Notes:**
- The public URL is automatically generated and shareable with anyone
- Free Gradio URLs expire after 1 week
- A new URL is generated each time you run the dashboard
- For permanent hosting, deploy to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) using `gradio deploy`
- The interface is also embedded directly in the notebook output

**Required Fields:**
- Car Name (e.g., "Maruti Swift Dzire VDI")
- Manufacturing Year
- Kilometers Driven
- Fuel Type (Diesel, Petrol, LPG, CNG)
- Transmission (Manual, Automatic)
- Owner (First Owner, Second Owner, etc.)

**Optional Fields:**
- Mileage (format: "23.4 kmpl" or "17.3 km/kg")
- Engine (format: "1248 CC")
- Max Power (format: "74 bhp")
- Torque (format: "190Nm@ 2000rpm")
- Number of Seats

**Note:** The dashboard uses the trained model variables directly from the notebook's namespace, so make sure all model training cells have been executed first.

**Accessing the Dashboard URL:**

When you run Cell 82, Gradio will automatically generate a public URL. The URL will be displayed in the notebook output, for example:

```
Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860
Running on public URL: https://1152680073981e44ef.gradio.live

This share link expires in 1 week. For free permanent hosting and GPU upgrades, 
run `gradio deploy` from the terminal to deploy to Hugging Face Spaces.
```

**Important Notes:**
- The public URL is automatically generated and shareable
- Free Gradio URLs expire after 1 week
- The URL is unique each time you run the dashboard
- For permanent hosting, deploy to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) using `gradio deploy`
- The interface also works locally at `http://127.0.0.1:7860` when running in Jupyter
- In Google Colab, the public URL allows access from anywhere

## 📈 Methodology

### Data Cleaning Pipeline

1. **Name Parsing**: Extract make (brand) and model from car names
2. **Mileage Normalization**: Convert km/kg to kmpl using fuel density ratios
3. **Torque Processing**: Extract torque values and normalize units (kgm → Nm)
4. **RPM Extraction**: Parse RPM information from various formats (ranges, +/- notation)

### Enhanced Preprocessing Pipeline

1. **KNN Imputation**: Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (n_neighbors=5) to impute missing values. This is more sophisticated than median imputation as it considers relationships between features to provide more accurate missing value estimates.
2. **Standard Scaling**: Normalizes features to have zero mean and unit variance
3. **Polynomial Features**: Creates interaction features (degree=2, interaction_only=True) to capture multiplicative relationships between features (e.g., age × kms_driven, age × max_power_value). The `interaction_only=True` parameter means only interaction terms are created, not squared terms.

### Feature Engineering

1. **Temporal Features**: Calculate car age from manufacturing year
2. **Usage Features**: Compute kilometers per year and flag abnormal usage
3. **Encoding Features**: 
   - Frequency encoding for make/model popularity
   - Residual encoding for model-specific price patterns
4. **Target Transformation**: Apply log1p transformation to handle skewness

### Model Training Strategy

1. **Baseline Models**: Start with simple linear models (Ridge) with enhanced preprocessing (KNN imputation + polynomial features)
2. **Tree-Based Models**: Evaluate Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Stack multiple models for improved performance
4. **Advanced Techniques**: 
   - Target encoding for high-cardinality features (make, model)
   - Quantile regression for uncertainty estimation
   - Cross-validation with honest target encoding (out-of-fold predictions)
   - Early stopping for gradient boosting models
